    "# Lists\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "Lists are one of the most commonly used data structures in Python and are very similar to arrays from other programming languages. A list can store many items or values inside of one overall object or structure, unlike a variable which can only store one item or value inside one object. \n",
    "\n",
    "The items in a list can be accessed by using what is called an “index” value, which simply refers to the position of a certain item inside of a list, as lists are ordered from item 0 to the number of elements - 1. Therefore a list with 5 elements will have index positions 0 through 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "Any data can be stored inside a list, numbers, strings, or objects, but it is common practice to only have one data type per list. Therefore if my list has integers, it would ONLY have integers, not strings, doubles, objects, etc."
